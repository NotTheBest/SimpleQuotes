## Personal Documentation for Simple Quotes Project

**My own simple documentation for my own personal use to look back upon.**

I created this project after doing coding on and off and really wanting to get into coding seriously.
Doing freeCodeCamp previously and creating simple projects along the way on CodePen, I really wanted to sit down and do a real project that I could see the results of and would force me to improve my skills.

Over this project I learned/improved on
* The basics of GitHub and Git
* Javascript API calls
* JSON
* HTML formatting with CSS
* Naming classes and such with CSS
* CSS grids and responsive pages
* JavaScript dates
* Website files and general website information
as well as other skills.

From this project, I aim to do more projects, possibly one every month, while continuing freeCodeCamp and learning more along the way.
From here, I want to be able to be pursue frontend web design but to also work on backend languages in the future.

This project was started around October 8 and was concluded around October 26.
