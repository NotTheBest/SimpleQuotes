# Simple Quotes

A clean, __responsive__ website that displays a daily quote and quotes from different subjects.

Quotes update every day. *Project is archived - quotes will not update*

## Why Quotes?

I really love quotes and the underlying meaning behind them. Quotes can reveal a different point of view and can give a different perspective that we would have never thought of. A simple string of words can otherwise reveal the reason for existence.

## About

The aim of this project is to help improve my web development skills with html, css, and javascript.
My very first project to be uploaded to GitHub. Feedback and constructive criticism is much appreciated.

I hope you enjoy!
